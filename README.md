### Minecraft Forge Mod - Final Project
##### Personas :
###### Jonathan, a young student
---
Jonathan, age 13, is a teenager who recently started playing video games because of the influence of gaming influencers on YouTube and Twitch. He comes from a middle-class family, so they do not have spare funds lying around for video games. Jonathan has an older brother, Peter, who plays a lot of video games, and since Jonathan looks at his older brother as a role model, he wants to start playing video games too. Peter has recently allowed Jonathan to start playing one of his games, Minecraft. When Jonathan goes to middle-school each day, he primarily discusses the video game concepts where he is having a hard time with his friends during recess and lunch. Other than school and video games, as a child, Jonathan, does not have any responsibility, so his primary focus is currently Minecraft.
Being a younger boy in today’s day-of-age, Jonathan obviously knows how to use most of today’s common technology such as any Apple product and PCs, so he is adept at using technology at a young age. Although, he is having a hard time understanding all the new concepts that are introduced to you when you first begin playing Minecraft. Rather than ask his brother, Jonathan wants to learn easiest and fastest strategies for playing the game on his own. He wants to quickly beat the game so that he can impress his brother too.
